Synixe is a crowdsourced endeavor, meaning that it run entirely by our own members who volunteer to help. If you appreciate what we do and you'd like to get involved, you can help us by making missions, programming features, or helping with our documentation; let one of our staff members know if you'd like to get involved! And if you have the cash to spare, you can also help us cover our server and hardware expenses by donating over at https://www.patreon.com/synixe. Thank you!
