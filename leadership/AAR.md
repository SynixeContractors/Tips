Leadership has to write an After Action Report (AAR) after each mission. This includes the assets utilized, the attendees, and the casualties, and is used to track who will be paid, and how much the contract will be paid for. A good idea is to take a screenshot of the member map list at the end of the mission to help you remember who attended and who died during a contract. If map markers and drawings were used, taking a screenshot of this can also help remember how the contract was executed.
