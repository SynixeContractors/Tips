Radio communications should be clear, concise, and effective. A good method to ensure clarity is to utilise a common radio protocol. When hailing someone, first state the team you are speaking to, the team who is transmitting (yours), then your message. 

A good example would be: "Red, this is Yellow, message", and then wait for a reply before transmitting the full message.

Another good practise is to first check if the other team is available to receive your message before transmitting when able, otherwise, you may be relaying information to them at a time they're not able to listen for various motives, such as gunfight, planning, or talking to others.
