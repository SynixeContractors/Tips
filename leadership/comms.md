Radio communications should be clear, concise, and effective. A good method to ensure clarity is to utilise a common radio protocol. When hailing someone, first state the team you are speaking to, the team who is transmitting (yours), then your message. 

A good example would be: "Red, this is Yellow, message, over", and then wait for a reply before transmitting the full message. When a message is ended with "over", it means that you are expecting a reply. If the message ends with "out", this means that the conversation has finished and a reply is not needed, however, this is usually only done by the person who initiated the radio communication.

Another good practise is to first check if the other team is available to receive your message before transmitting when able, otherwise, you may be relaying information to them at a time they're not able to listen for various motives, such as gunfight, planning, or talking to others.
